# Example environment variables for Firebase configuration.
#
# Use this file as a reference for required keys. In CI/CD, set these as
# GitHub Secrets so they are available during `npm run build`.
# For local development, you may copy this file to `.env` (or
# `.env.development.local`) and populate with values from Firebase Console →
# Project Settings → General → Your Web App's SDK configuration.
#
# Never commit your real credentials to version control. Use placeholders here
# that are clearly non-sensitive and will not trigger secret scanners.
