# Add Product UX Options (Pre-Implementation)

These mockups explore 3 alternatives for the Shot Editor "Add Product" flow.

- `option-1-smart-search-modal.html`  
  Search-first modal with lightweight facet chips and inline create actions.
- `option-2-split-drawer.html`  
  Right-side drawer with persistent filters, wider result list, and cart.
- `option-3-inline-composer.html`  
  In-rail composer inside Looks panel for low-context-switch assignment.

All mockups are static HTML for interaction/design review only (no runtime wiring).
