# Session Summary â€“ 2025-10-24

## Focus
- Converted the shot editor into tab-aware autosave mode: debounced writes per section, guarded against active full saves, and dedicated error handling.
- Surfaced per-tab status messaging (pending / saving / saved / error) with last-saved timestamps and short toasts on success.
- Preserved keyboard-friendly navigation and ensured attachment uploads feed into the same autosave loop.

## Results
- `src/pages/ShotsPage.jsx` now orchestrates autosave timers, prevents double-writes, and updates the cached draft after each successful mutation.
- `src/components/shots/ShotEditModal.jsx` displays section status chips and uses arrow-key tabbing with roving focus.
- Targeted tests (`ShotEditModal.portal`, `ShotsPage.bulkOperations`, `ShotsPage.bulkTagging`) and lint all pass locally.

## Next Steps
- Implement sidebar summary (status, schedule, tags) that remains visible while switching tabs.
- Add explicit keyboard-nav coverage in tests to verify Arrow/Home/End behaviour.
- After autosave UX hardening, evaluate whether to persist read-only snapshots for undo.
