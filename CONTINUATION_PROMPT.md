# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 14B just completed - Batch Image Upload with security fixes applied.

## Current Status

**Phase 14B Complete** ‚úÖ (PR #189 awaiting merge with security fixes)
- **25/25 phases done** - All mockup-inspired UI/UX improvements complete! üéâ
- Latest work: Phase 14A (CSV/Excel Export) + Phase 14B (Batch Image Upload)
- Branch: `feat/phase14b-batch-image-upload`
- All 184 tests passing (zero regressions)
- Build: 8.63s | Bundle: 287.01 kB gzipped
- Security fixes applied to PR #189 (6 critical issues resolved)

**Latest Work**:
- **Phase 14A**: Universal CSV/Excel export with column selection (PR #188 ‚úÖ Merged)
- **Phase 14B**: Drag & drop batch image upload with automatic compression (PR #189 ‚è∏Ô∏è Open)
- Security enhancements: File type whitelist, size validation, CSV injection prevention
- Stability fixes: Race condition prevention, memory leak fixes

## Quick Reference

**Documentation** (Read these first):
1. **Master Roadmap**: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
   - Complete 25-phase history
   - Feature priorities and future opportunities

2. **Latest Sessions**:
   - `/PHASE14A_CSV_EXCEL_EXPORT_SESSION.md` - Export implementation
   - `/PHASE14B_BATCH_IMAGE_UPLOAD_SESSION.md` - Batch upload implementation

3. **Architecture**: `/docs/shot_builder_overview_updated.md`, `/docs/shot_builder_structure.md`

**Tech Stack**:
- React 18 + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 3
- Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- TanStack Query v5 (100% caching coverage)
- react-window (list virtualization)
- xlsx (CSV/Excel export, code-split)
- Testing: Vitest + RTL (184 tests passing)

## What I Need

**Option 1**: Complete Phase 14C - Advanced Search & Filter Presets
- Global search with fuse.js (already installed)
- Filter preset save/load functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for search)
- Smart search across shots, products, talent, locations
- Expected time: 3-4 hours

**Option 2**: Testing & Quality Improvements
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Component test coverage expansion
- Visual regression testing
- Performance profiling

**Option 3**: Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design refinements
- Touch gesture improvements
- Mobile-specific UI patterns
- PWA capabilities

**Option 4**: Specific feature/improvement
- Tell me what you want to build/fix
- I'll create a plan and implement

## Your Approach

Please:
1. **Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`** for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current state
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

## Important Guardrails

- ‚úÖ **Read files before editing** - Use Read tool first
- ‚úÖ **Follow patterns** - Check similar implementations
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** - All 184 tests must pass
- ‚úÖ **Document changes** - Create session docs for significant work
- ‚úÖ **Zero regressions** - Maintain backwards compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Performance** - Monitor bundle size and build time
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- ‚úÖ **Security** - Validate inputs, prevent injection attacks

## Project Health

**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready

**Features**:
- üé® Modern UI design system

- Firestore reads: 50-80% reduction via TanStack Query

## Potential Next Steps

Based on the roadmap, here are high-value opportunities:

### Phase 14C: Advanced Search & Filter Presets (Recommended)
**Why**: Improves discoverability and workflow efficiency
**What**:
- Global search with fuse.js (fuzzy matching)
- Filter preset save/load (quick access to common views)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
- Smart search across all entity types

**Impact**: HIGH - Makes large datasets more manageable
**Effort**: MEDIUM - 3-4 hours
**Risk**: LOW - fuse.js already installed

### Alternative Options

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Higher test coverage

**Mobile Experience**:
- Touch gesture improvements
- Responsive refinements
- Mobile-first UI patterns
