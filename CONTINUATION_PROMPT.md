# Shot Builder - UI/UX Improvements Continuation Prompt

**Version**: Phase 9 Complete (Updated 2025-10-08)
**Current Branch**: `feat/phase9-animations`
**Production Status**: Ready for review

---

## Quick Context

I'm continuing UI/UX design improvements for my **Shot Builder** Firebase application - a production app for managing wardrobe/styling photo shoots with clients, projects, shots, products, and pulls.

### Current Status: 9/10 Phases Complete ✅

**Recently Completed**:
- ✅ **Phase 9** (PR #171): Animations & transitions - staggered card entrance, filter panel slide-ins
- ✅ **Phase 8** (PR #170): Active filter pills with dismiss functionality
- ✅ **Phases 1-7**: All merged to main (card hover, StatusBadge, EmptyState, icons, progress bars, planner enhancements)

**Next Up**:
- ⬜ **Phase 10**: Accessibility & Performance (final polish)

---

## What I Need

### Option 1: Complete Phase 10 (Recommended)
Final accessibility audit and performance optimization:
- ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Performance optimizations (lazy loading, memoization)
- Bundle size analysis

### Option 2: Extend Animations
If you prefer more animation polish before Phase 10:
- Add animations to ShotsPage
- Modal entrance/exit transitions
- Button active states throughout

### Option 3: Custom Request
Tell me what specific feature or improvement you'd like to tackle.

## Key Reference Files

**Master Roadmap**: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Tracks all 10 phases and completion status
- Contains design system patterns and code examples

**Latest Session**: `/PHASE9_ANIMATIONS_SESSION.md`
- Details from most recent work
- Animation patterns and utilities

**Design Tokens**:
- Primary: `#6366f1` (indigo-500)

**Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

## Important Guidelines

1. **Always read files before editing** - Critical to avoid regressions
2. **Test with production build** - Run `npm run build` before committing
3. **Follow established patterns** - Check existing components for consistency
4. **Create session documentation** - Document what was done for continuity
5. **Update master roadmap** - Mark phases complete in MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/phase10-accessibility

# After implementation
