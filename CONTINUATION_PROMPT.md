# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 12.9.1 just completed - deferred UX improvements and code review fixes.

## Current Status

**Phase 12.9.1 Complete** ✅ (PR #186 ready to merge)
- 22 phases complete total
- Branch: `feat/phase12.9.1-deferred-ux-improvements`
- All 184 tests passing (+4 new tests)
- Build time: 8.78s
- Bundle size: 286.72 kB gzipped (unchanged)

**Latest Work**:
- Added configurable column support to VirtualizedGrid
- Fixed ProductsPage to use 2-5 responsive columns
- Created CreateProductCard for gallery view (UX consistency)
- Enhanced keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space support)
- Debounced resize handler to reduce re-renders
- Comprehensive test coverage for new features

## Tech Stack

**Core**:

- react-window (list virtualization)

**Key Libraries**:
- react-beautiful-dnd (drag-and-drop)
- recharts (analytics)
- jspdf + jspdf-autotable (PDF generation)
- lucide-react (icons)

**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (184 tests, all passing)

## What I Need

**Option 1**: Review and suggest next phase
- Read master roadmap for full context
- Identify highest-value improvements
- Create implementation plan

**Option 2**: Address a specific feature or bug
- Tell me what you want to improve
- I'll create a plan and implement

**Option 3**: Performance or code quality improvements
- Bundle optimization
- Test coverage expansion
- Accessibility enhancements

## Your Approach

Please:
1. **Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` first** for full project context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

## Important Notes

- **Always read files before editing** - Use Read tool first
- **Follow existing patterns** - Check similar implementations
- **Test thoroughly** - All 184 tests must pass
- **Document changes** - Create session docs for significant work
- **Zero regressions** - Maintain backwards compatibility
- **Performance matters** - Check bundle size and build time
- **Accessibility first** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
