# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 13 just completed - Animation & Interaction Polish.

## Current Status

**Phase 13 Complete** ✅ (PR #TBD ready to merge)
- 23 phases complete total
- Branch: `feat/phase13-animation-polish`
- All 184 tests passing (zero regressions)
- Build time: 8.21s (6.5% faster)
- Bundle size: 286.91 kB gzipped (+0.19 kB, 0.07%)

**Latest Work**:
- Modal transitions (fade + zoom entrance, 300ms)
- Button interactions (active press, hover lift)
- Enhanced loading states (gradient shimmer, fade overlays)
- Dropdown animations (fade + slide-in, staggered items)
- Micro-interactions (icon rotations, color picker stagger)
- Zero bundle overhead (+0.19 kB for premium polish)

## What I Need

**Option 1**: Review and suggest next phase
- Read master roadmap for full context
- Identify highest-value improvements
- Create implementation plan

**Option 2**: Address a specific feature or bug
- Tell me what you want to improve
- I'll create a plan and implement

**Option 3**: Performance or code quality improvements
- Bundle optimization
- Test coverage expansion
- Accessibility enhancements

## Your Approach

Please:
1. **Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` first** for full project context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

## Important Notes

- **Always read files before editing** - Use Read tool first
- **Follow existing patterns** - Check similar implementations
- **Test thoroughly** - All 184 tests must pass
- **Document changes** - Create session docs for significant work
- **Zero regressions** - Maintain backwards compatibility
- **Performance matters** - Check bundle size and build time
- **Accessibility first** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
