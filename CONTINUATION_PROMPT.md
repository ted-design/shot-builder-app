# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 12.8 just completed.

**Current Status**: 20 phases done ‚úÖ
- Latest: Phase 12.8 - Complete PlannerPage TanStack Query Migration (‚úÖ Complete)
- Complete: Intelligent caching across ALL pages (50-80% Firestore read reduction), PDF optimization, tag system, bulk operations, list virtualization
- Next: Expand virtualization OR new features

**Branch**: `main` (all work merged)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE12.8_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase + TanStack Query + react-window

**What I need**:

**[Option 1] Expand List Virtualization**
- Virtualize ProjectsPage and ProductsPage
- Virtualize PlannerPage lane view
- Add dynamic height support for variable-sized items
- **Impact**: Consistent performance across all pages
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 2] Planner Enhancements**
- Timeline view for project scheduling
- Capacity planning (shots per day/location)
- Drag-and-drop improvements
- Lane templates and presets
- Export timeline to calendar
- **Estimated time**: 4-5 hours, MEDIUM risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 3] Pulls Advanced Workflows**
- Advanced sharing options (password protection, expiry)
- Custom pull templates
- Bulk add items with filters
- Pull analytics (views, downloads)
- Client feedback collection
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 4] Products Bulk Operations**
- Bulk edit products (pricing, availability, categories)
- Batch import from CSV/Excel
- Product templates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Product analytics
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 5] Tell Me What You Need**
- Specific feature request
- Bug fixes or optimizations
- Testing or deployment
- Documentation updates
- Custom improvement

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns.
