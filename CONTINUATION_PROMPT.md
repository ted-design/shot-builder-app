# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 12.7 just completed.

**Current Status**: 19 phases done ✅
- Latest: Phase 12.7 - List Virtualization (PR #183 - in review)
- Complete: Intelligent caching across 3 pages (50-80% Firestore read reduction), PDF optimization, tag system, bulk operations, list virtualization
- Next: PlannerPage migration OR new feature areas

**Branch**: `feat/phase12.7-list-virtualization` (ready for PR)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE12.6_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase + TanStack Query

**What I need**:

**[Option 1] Phase 12.7: Complete PlannerPage TanStack Query Migration**
- Migrate PlannerPage to use cached hooks (useLanes, useShots, useProducts, useTalent, useLocations)
- Refactor complex shot merging logic for TanStack Query compatibility
- Migrate all 7 Firestore subscriptions to cached hooks
- `useLanes` hook already created and ready
- **Impact**: Complete caching coverage across entire app, maximize Firestore savings
- **Estimated time**: 4-6 hours, MEDIUM risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 2] Phase 12.7: List Virtualization**
- Install react-window for virtualized lists
- Virtualize ShotsPage list view (handles 1000+ items smoothly)
- Conditional virtualization for large grids
- **Impact**: Smooth 60 FPS scrolling with massive datasets
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours, LOW risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 3] Planner Enhancements**
- Timeline view for project scheduling
- Capacity planning (shots per day/location)
- Drag-and-drop improvements
- Lane templates and presets
- Export timeline to calendar
- **Estimated time**: 4-5 hours, MEDIUM risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 4] Pulls Advanced Workflows**
- Advanced sharing options (password protection, expiry)
- Custom pull templates
- Bulk add items with filters
- Pull analytics (views, downloads)
- Client feedback collection
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 5] Products Bulk Operations**
- Bulk edit products (pricing, availability, categories)
- Batch import from CSV/Excel
- Product templates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Product analytics
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 6] Tell Me What You Need**
- Specific feature request
- Bug fixes or optimizations
- Testing or deployment
- Documentation updates
- Custom improvement

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns.
