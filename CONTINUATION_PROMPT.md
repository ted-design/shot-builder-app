# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development of my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 17B (Activity Feed) foundation just completed.

## Current Status: 35/36 Phases Complete ✅

**Latest**: Phase 17B Foundation - Activity Feed & Timeline (3 commits on `feat/phase17b-activity-feed`)
- Foundation complete: Activity logging, timeline UI, comment integration, Firestore rules/indexes
- Integration pending: Shot mutation logging, project view integration, Firebase deployment (~1-2 hours)

**Recent**: Phase 17A (Comments & Mentions), Bug fixes (PRs #207, #210), Production cleanup (PR #209)

**Next Options**: Complete Phase 17B integration OR Phase 17C (Enhanced Public Sharing) OR custom improvements

## Branch

Current: `feat/phase17b-activity-feed` (unmerged, foundation complete)
Main: `main` (create new branch from main for Phase 17C or custom work)

## Quick Reference

**Master Roadmap**: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
**Latest Session**: `/PHASE17B_ACTIVITY_FEED_SESSION.md`
**Tech Stack**: React 18 + Vite 6 + Tailwind + Firebase + TanStack Query v5
**Bundle**: 252.01 kB gzipped | **Tests**: 351 passing | **Build**: ~10s

## What I Need

### Option 1: Complete Phase 17B Integration (Recommended, 1-2 hours)

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. **Deploy Firestore Configuration** (10 min)
   - Run: `firebase login --reauth` (requires user auth)
   - Run: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes,firestore:rules`
   - Verify: `firebase firestore:indexes`

2. **Add Activity Logging to Shot Mutations** (30 min)
   - Update `useCreateShot`, `useUpdateShot`, `useDeleteShot` in `/src/hooks/useFirestoreMutations.js`
   - Follow pattern from `/src/hooks/useComments.js:109-145` (comment logging)
   - Import from `/src/lib/activityLogger.js`
   - Use `onSuccess` callbacks with non-blocking logging

3. **Integrate Timeline into Project View** (20 min)
   - Import `ActivityTimeline` into project view page (find via Glob: `**/*project*view*.jsx`)
   - Pass `clientId` and `projectId` props
   - Add section with heading: "Recent Activity"

4. **Test & Verify** (30 min)
   - Create test shot → verify activity logged
   - Add comment with @mention → verify activity logged
   - Update shot status → verify STATUS_CHANGED activity
   - Check timeline filters work correctly
   - Verify dark mode rendering

**Success Criteria**: Timeline displays in project view, all mutations log activities, real-time updates work, 351 tests passing.

### Option 2: Phase 17C - Enhanced Public Sharing (6-8 hours)
- Project sharing with public links
- Per-link permissions (view, comment, full access)
- Expiring share tokens with configurable TTL
- External collaborator support without Firebase accounts
- Share management UI (create/revoke/list links)

### Option 3: Testing & Quality Improvements
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression testing
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Load testing for scale validation

### Option 4: Mobile Optimization
- Responsive refinements for mobile layouts
- Touch gesture improvements
- PWA capabilities (offline support, installable)
- Mobile-specific UX enhancements

### Option 5: Custom Improvement
Tell me what specific feature or improvement you want, and I'll implement it following the established architecture patterns.

## Your Approach

**Implementation Protocol**:

1. **Plan with TodoWrite** - Break task into subtasks for tracking
2. **Read Context** - Use Read tool on session docs and relevant files
3. **Follow Patterns** - Match established architecture (see roadmap for examples)
4. **Test Incrementally** - Run tests during implementation, not just at end
5. **Update Docs** - Keep session docs and roadmap current

**Quality Standards**:
- Zero test regressions (351 tests must pass)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (keyboard nav, ARIA, contrast)
- Bundle monitoring (target: <260 kB gzipped)
- Build time: <12s target
- Dark mode compatible
- Input validation and security

**If Choosing Option 1** (Phase 17B Integration):
- Read `/PHASE17B_ACTIVITY_FEED_SESSION.md:296-330` for integration checklist
- Reference `/src/hooks/useComments.js:109-145` for activity logging pattern
- Reference `/src/lib/activityLogger.js` for helper functions
- Test each integration step before moving to next

**Deliverables**:
- Working implementation with tests passing
- Session documentation (if significant changes)
- Git commits with descriptive messages
- Update roadmap status when complete

## Key Principles

✅ **Reference, don't embed** - Point to file paths, don't copy large code blocks
✅ **Just-in-time context** - Read files when needed, not upfront
✅ **Forward-focused** - Solve the problem, minimize retrospectives
✅ **Test incrementally** - Don't batch testing at end
✅ **Zero breaking changes** - Backwards compatibility critical
✅ **Non-blocking operations** - Activity logging must never break core features

## Project Health

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready (35/36 phases complete)

**Recent Improvements**:
- 🎨 Modern top navigation (horizontal layout, breadcrumbs, quick actions)
- 💬 Collaboration (comments, @mentions, real-time notifications)
- 🎯 Activity tracking foundation (90-day retention, real-time timeline)
- 🌙 Complete dark mode (100% coverage)
- ⚡ Performance (TanStack caching, virtualization, debounced search)
- 🔍 Advanced search (Cmd+K, fuzzy matching, filter presets)
- 📊 CSV/Excel export (universal)
- 🧪 351 tests passing (comprehensive coverage)

**Metrics**:
- Build: ~10s
- Tests: 351 passing (100% pass rate)
- Performance: 60 FPS with 10k+ items
- Firestore: 50-80% read reduction via caching
- Zero critical issues

## Firebase Deployment Note

**Current Firebase State**:
- Firestore rules and indexes updated locally
- **Deployment required** to activate Phase 17B in production
- Commands: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes,firestore:rules`
- Note: Requires `firebase login --reauth` (user authentication)

## Notes

- Phase 17B foundation complete (3 commits: activity logger, UI components, comment integration)
- Integration tasks are straightforward and well-documented
- All patterns established, just need to apply to remaining hooks and integrate UI
- Option 1 (integration) is quickest path to complete Phase 17B
- Ready for Phase 17C or custom improvements after Option 1
