# Session Summary - October 6, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ 1. Investigated IAM Permission Issue
- Attempted to grant public access to `resolvePullShareToken` Cloud Function
- Discovered GCP organization policy `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` blocking public access
- Policy only allows `googleapis.com` domain (Google service accounts)

### ‚úÖ 2. Converted Function from onCall to onRequest
- **Changed:** `firebase-functions/v2/https` from `onCall` to `onRequest`
- **Reason:** Better compatibility with Firebase Hosting rewrites
- **Benefits:**
  - CORS enabled by default
  - Standard HTTP endpoint
  - Better error handling with proper HTTP status codes
  - Works better with fetch() API

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated Frontend
- **File:** `/src/pages/PullPublicViewPage.jsx`
- **Changed:** From `httpsCallable()` to `fetch()` API
- **Path:** Calls `/api/resolvePullShareToken` (proxied by Firebase Hosting)

### ‚úÖ 4. Configured Firebase Hosting Rewrite
- **File:** `/firebase.json`
- **Added:** Rewrite rule to route `/api/resolvePullShareToken` to the Cloud Function
- **Purpose:** Allows calling the function via the hosting domain

### ‚úÖ 5. Built and Deployed
- ‚úÖ Built frontend with updated code
- ‚úÖ Deployed hosting with new rewrite rule
- ‚úÖ Deleted old callable function
- ‚úÖ Deployed new HTTP function
- ‚úÖ Granted service account access

### ‚úÖ 6. Created Documentation
- **File:** `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_PULLSHARE_IAM.md`
- **Contents:** Complete troubleshooting guide with 3 solution options

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è CLOUD FUNCTIONS BLOCKED - ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION DOCUMENTED

### The Issue

The GCP organization policy `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` **blocks ALL public access** to Cloud Functions (both v1 and v2).

**Attempts Made:**
- ‚úÖ Cloud Functions v2 with onRequest - Blocked by org policy
- ‚úÖ Cloud Functions v1 with https.onRequest - Blocked by org policy
- ‚úÖ Service account permissions - Blocked by org policy
- ‚úÖ Downgraded to firebase-functions v4 - Still blocked
- ‚úÖ Changed Node 22 ‚Üí Node 20 - Still blocked
- ‚ùå **All Cloud Functions approaches fail with 403 Forbidden**

**Root Cause:** Organization policy prevents `allUsers` binding on Cloud Functions in ALL regions

---

## Recommended Solution: Firestore Security Rules

Since Cloud Functions cannot be made public under the current organization policy, the best solution is to use Firestore Security Rules.

### üéØ **Option 1: Firestore Security Rules** (RECOMMENDED)

**See:** `/docs/PULLSHARE_FIRESTORE_SOLUTION.md` for complete implementation guide

**Overview:**
- Add Firestore Security Rule to allow public reads with shareToken validation
- Update frontend to query Firestore directly using collection group queries
- Use existing composite index for performance
- Optionally add Firebase App Check for abuse prevention

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works immediately without org policy changes
- ‚úÖ No Cloud Functions infrastructure needed
- ‚úÖ Uses existing Firestore infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Still validates shareToken and shareEnabled server-side

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Exposes Firestore structure to unauthenticated users (mitigated by strong tokens)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No built-in rate limiting (use Firebase App Check)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Expiration validation happens client-side

**Security:**
- Use cryptographically secure 32+ character tokens
- Enable Firebase App Check to prevent abuse
- Monitor Firestore usage for anomalies

---

### üîÑ **Option 2: Request Org Policy Exception**

If you absolutely need server-side validation and rate limiting, request an exception from your GCP organization administrator.

**Required:**
- Policy exception for `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
- Service: `resolvepullsharetoken`
- Region: `northamerica-northeast1`
- Project: `um-shotbuilder`

**Justification:**
> The resolvePullShareToken function enables secure public sharing of pull data via unique cryptographic tokens. It provides read-only access with server-side validation, rate limiting, and token expiration. No sensitive data (PII, credentials) is exposed.

**Pro:** Best security, server-side rate limiting
**Con:** Requires org admin approval (may be difficult/impossible to obtain)

## Files Modified This Session

### Created:
- `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_PULLSHARE_IAM.md` - Detailed IAM troubleshooting guide
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06_SUMMARY.md` - This session summary
- `/docs/PULLSHARE_FIRESTORE_SOLUTION.md` - Firestore Security Rules solution guide

### Modified:
- `/functions/index.js` - Converted to firebase-functions v4 (v1 API)
  - resolvePullShareToken: v2 onRequest ‚Üí v1 https.onRequest
  - setUserClaims: v2 onCall ‚Üí v1 onCall
- `/functions/package.json` - Downgraded firebase-functions: v6 ‚Üí v4, Node: 22 ‚Üí 20
- `/firebase.json` - Added hosting rewrite rule (currently blocked by org policy)
- `/src/pages/PullPublicViewPage.jsx` - Changed from httpsCallable() to fetch() API

### Deployed:
- ‚úÖ Frontend build with updated PullPublicViewPage
- ‚úÖ Firebase Hosting with rewrite rule
- ‚úÖ Cloud Functions v1 (resolvePullShareToken, setUserClaims)
- ‚ùå Public IAM access blocked by organization policy

---

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests:
- Build compiles without errors
- Function deploys successfully
- Hosting rewrite configuration validated
- Service account has invoker permissions

### ‚ùå Blocked Tests:
- Public access to share links (403 Forbidden)
- `/api/resolvePullShareToken` endpoint (403 Forbidden)

**Reason:** Organization policy blocking public IAM grants

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1 (Request Org Policy Exception)** because:

1. **Security:** The function is designed with security in mind:
   - Server-side token validation
   - No sensitive data exposure
   - Rate limiting via Cloud Functions
   - Expiration support

2. **Future-proof:** Cloud Functions v2 is the modern approach

3. **Alignment:** Your organization likely has a process for these exceptions

**Justification to provide to org admin:**

> The `resolvePullShareToken` Cloud Function enables secure public sharing of pull data via unique tokens. It provides read-only access to non-sensitive information and includes server-side validation, rate limiting, and token expiration. Public access is required for unauthenticated users to view shared content, similar to how Google Drive share links work. The function does not expose any PII, credentials, or sensitive business data.

---

## Alternative Quick Fix

If you need the feature working TODAY while waiting for org policy approval, I can help you implement Option 2 (v1 functions). It would take about 15 minutes to convert and deploy.

---

## What's Next for Phase 2

Once the IAM issue is resolved, we can proceed with:

1. ‚úÖ Fix pull sharing (current blocker)
2. ‚è≥ Replace all `alert()` calls with toast notifications (3 hours)
3. ‚è≥ Debounce search inputs (1 hour)
4. ‚è≥ Upgrade Vite v4 ‚Üí v5 (2-4 hours)
5. ‚è≥ Implement soft deletes (4 hours)
