I need you to implement Phase 1 UI improvements for my Shot Builder app based on HTML mockup designs. This is a continuation of our design system implementation work.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Design system foundation deployed (Tailwind config, Card/Button components, StatusBadge, Skeleton)
- ‚úÖ Products page header improvements (sticky, text truncation)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard page improvements (sticky header, skeleton loading)
- ‚úÖ Mockup assessment complete (see `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`)
- üìç **Current branch**: `main` (on latest commit)

**What Needs to be Done (Phase 1):**

Implement these 4 high-impact, low-effort UI improvements from HTML mockups:

### 1. Card Hover Lift Effect
- Update `Card` component to add transform on hover
- Cards should lift up 2px (`-translate-y-0.5`) with enhanced shadow
- Add `will-change: transform` for performance
- Apply to Products and Dashboard cards

### 2. StatusBadge Integration
- Use the existing `StatusBadge` component we already created
- **Products page**: Add status badges to product cards (NEW, Discontinued)
- **Dashboard page**: Add status badges to project cards (Active, Planning, Complete)
- Position badges appropriately (top-left on images, or in card header)

### 3. Search Icon Prefix
- Add search icon inside search input fields (left side)
- Use `lucide-react` Search icon (already a dependency)
- Apply to:
  - Products page search
  - Any other search fields in the app
- Position: `absolute left-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
- Add `pl-10` to input for proper spacing

### 4. Welcome Message (Dashboard)
- Add personalized greeting: "Welcome back, [Name]"
- Extract user name from auth context (`useAuth()`)
- Display in Dashboard header
- Fallback to "Welcome back" if no name available

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/ui/card.jsx` - Add hover lift
- `src/components/ui/StatusBadge.jsx` - Already exists, just integrate it
- `src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx` - Add search icon, status badges
- `src/pages/ProjectsPage.jsx` - Add welcome message, status badges

**Documentation References:**
- Full assessment: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Design system: `/docs/Claude/App Design/2025-10-07/design-system.md`
- Session summary: `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-08_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- HTML mockups: `/docs/Claude/App Design/2025-10-07/*.html`

**Success Criteria:**
- Cards lift on hover with smooth animation
- Status badges visible on relevant cards with correct colors
- Search fields have icon prefixes
- Dashboard shows personalized welcome message
- Build succeeds with no errors
- Changes committed to a new feature branch

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Expected Impact:** HIGH visual improvement

Please start by:
1. Creating a new feature branch: `feat/phase1-ui-improvements`
2. Reviewing the assessment doc to understand the patterns
3. Implementing the 4 improvements in order
4. Testing with `npm run build`
5. Committing and creating a PR

Let me know if you need any clarification on the requirements!
