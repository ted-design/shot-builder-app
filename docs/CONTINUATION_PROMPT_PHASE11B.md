```
I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 11A just completed.

**Current Status**: 11 phases done ✅
- Latest: Phase 11A - Mockup-Inspired UI Refinements (PR #174 - ready for review)
  - Added page descriptions and project context
  - Simplified product metadata display
  - Enhanced project cards with talent/location counts
- Next: Phase 11B options OR custom improvements

**Branch**: Create new from `main` after PR #174 merges

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE11A_MOCKUP_REFINEMENTS_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

**What I need**:
[Option 1] Phase 11B - Top Navigation Bar: Migrate from sidebar to modern top nav
[Option 2] Phase 11B - Color-Coded Shot Tags: Add tagging system with filters
[Option 3] Phase 11B - Recent Activity: Add activity timeline to dashboard
[Option 4] Tell you a specific improvement I want

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns.

## Token Efficiency

**Old prompt style**: ~8-10k tokens (2000+ lines with full implementation history)
**New prompt style**: ~400 tokens (~40 lines with doc references)
**Savings**: ~95% reduction in prompt size

**Strategy**:
- Reference docs instead of embedding content
- Just-in-time context (agent reads when needed)
- Forward-focused (next phase, not past work)
- State snapshot (X phases done vs listing all)
