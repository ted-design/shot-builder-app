# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development for my Shot Builder Firebase app. **Phase 16.1** just completed - Navigation Enhancements! ⚡✨

## Current Status: 32/32 phases done ✅

**Latest**: Phase 16.1 - Top Navigation Enhancements (PR #196 - Merged Oct 14)
- ✅ Search trigger button: Cmd+K indicator for discoverability
- ✅ SearchCommandContext: Programmatic search control
- ✅ Quick Actions menu: 8 navigation shortcuts with color-coded icons
- ✅ Avatar component: Photos + colored initials fallback (8-color palette)
- ✅ User avatars in menu button, dropdown, and mobile nav
- ✅ Build validated: 247.50 kB gzipped (+1.85 kB = +0.75%)
- ✅ All 253 tests passing (CI green)
- **Result**: Enhanced discoverability, fast navigation, personalization!

**Branch**: `main` (or create new feature branch)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE16.1_NAV_ENHANCEMENTS_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

## What I need:

**Option 1**: Start a new feature or polish task:
- Breadcrumb navigation below header for deep navigation context
- Notifications bell with badge count and dropdown
- Recent items in Quick Actions (recently accessed shots/projects)
- Avatar upload functionality
- Search filter in Quick Actions menu
- Additional page-level improvements

**Option 2**: Tell you a specific improvement or feature I want

**Option 3**: Help with bug fixes, refactoring, or optimization

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Use `/PHASE16.1_NAV_ENHANCEMENTS_SESSION.md` for latest session details
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test, build, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns. Use lean prompts that reference docs instead of embedding them.
