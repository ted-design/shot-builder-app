## PROMPT START

I'm continuing UI/UX design improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase application. This is a production app for managing wardrobe/styling photo shoots with clients, projects, shots, products, and pulls.

### Current Status - UI Improvements

**Completed Phases: 8/10 ✅**

All design improvements from HTML mockups (`/docs/Claude/App Design/2025-10-07/`) have been successfully integrated:

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Quick Wins (card hover, StatusBadge, search icons, welcome message)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Typography & EmptyState component
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Card metadata enhancements (dates, shot counts)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Metadata icons (Calendar, Camera, User, MapPin, Package)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Progress bars & enhanced filter UI with badges
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Filter consistency across all pages (ProductsPage, ProjectsPage, ShotsPage)
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Planner enhancements (cursors, icons, badges, improved lanes)
- ✅ **Phase 8**: Active filter pills with dismiss functionality

**Recent Completion (Phase 8):**
- Added dismissible filter pills to ProductsPage, ProjectsPage, and ShotsPage
- Pills show active filters (e.g., "Status: Active", "Location: Studio A")
- Individual dismiss with X button
- Consistent styling: `bg-primary/10 text-primary border border-primary/20`
- PR: #170 (in review)

### Tech Stack & Context

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Design system established in Phases 1-7
- Primary color: `rgb(37, 99, 235)` with opacity variants

**Branch:** `feat/phase8-active-filter-pills`

**Key Documentation:**
- `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` - Master assessment & roadmap
- `/PHASE8_ACTIVE_FILTER_PILLS_SESSION.md` - Latest session details
- `/docs/CONTINUATION_PROMPT_PHASE9.md` - Next phase detailed prompt (if exists)

### Recommended Next Phase: Phase 9 (Animations & Transitions)

**Goal**: Add smooth, professional animations throughout the app

**Scope** (2-3 hours):
1. Micro-animations
   - Staggered card entrance animations
   - Smooth modal transitions
   - Button interaction feedback
   - Loading state animations

2. Transition refinements
   - Page transition effects
   - Filter panel slide-in
   - Dropdown animations
   - Enhanced toast notifications

**Alternative: Phase 10 (Accessibility & Performance)**
- Accessibility audit (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen readers)
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, memoization, bundle size)

### What I Need Help With

Please:

1. **Review current progress** - Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` to see completed phases
2. **Choose next phase** - Phase 9 (animations) or Phase 10 (accessibility) based on priority
3. **Create detailed plan** - Use TodoWrite to track implementation steps
4. **Implement changes** - Follow established design system patterns
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no regressions, check production build
6. **Document session** - Create session doc (like `PHASE9_ANIMATIONS_SESSION.md`)
7. **Create PR** - Commit changes and create pull request
8. **Update docs** - Update `MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` with completion

### Design System Tokens (Established)

**Colors:**
- Primary: `rgb(37, 99, 235)` / `#2563eb`
- Primary with opacity: `bg-primary/10`, `text-primary`, `border-primary/20`
- Slate variants: `slate-50` to `slate-900`

**Transitions:**
- Standard: `transition-all duration-150`
- Hover lift: `hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg`
- Smooth: `transition ease-in-out`

**Icons:** Lucide React (already installed)

### Important Notes

- App is in production - test thoroughly before deploying
- Always read files before editing
- Follow established design patterns from Phases 1-8
- Use existing components: Card, StatusBadge, EmptyState, ProgressBar
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Run `npm run build` to test production build

### Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build & test
npm run build

# Deploy (after PR approval)
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Create PR
git checkout -b feat/phase9-animations
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement Phase 9 animations and transitions"
git push -u origin feat/phase9-animations
gh pr create --base main
```

### Project Structure

```
/src
  /components - UI components
  /pages - Page components (ProductsPage, ProjectsPage, ShotsPage, PlannerPage)
  /lib - Utilities and helpers
  /hooks - Custom React hooks
/docs
  MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md - Master UI roadmap
  /Claude/App Design/2025-10-07/ - Original HTML mockups
```

Please start by reading `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` to understand what's been completed, then recommend whether we should tackle Phase 9 (animations) or Phase 10 (accessibility/performance) next.
