## PROMPT START

I'm continuing improvements to my Shot Builder Firebase application. This is a production application for managing wardrobe/styling photo shoots with clients, projects, shots, products, and pulls.

### Current Status

**Completed:** 17/25 planned improvements (68%)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (Critical Security):** 6/6 complete
  - Firestore backups, security headers, storage validation
  - Dynamic system admin management
  - Fixed public data exposure in pull sharing
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (High Priority Performance):** 5/5 complete
  - Code splitting, Firestore hook optimizations
  - Toast notifications replacing alert()
  - Debounced search inputs
  - Vite v7 upgrade
  - Soft deletes for products and shots
  - ProductsPage pagination
  - React.memo optimizations
- üîÑ **Phase 3 (Medium Priority):** 2/5 complete

**Recent Work (Session F - Oct 6, 2025):**
- Fixed N+1 query patterns in PullsPage (#17)
- Implemented batch loading for product SKUs
- Pre-loads all SKU data in parallel when pull details modal opens
- Eliminated loading delays when editing pull items
- All changes deployed to production successfully

**Production Status:**
- ‚úÖ All features working correctly
- ‚úÖ No critical issues
- ‚úÖ Build time: ~6.8s
- ‚úÖ Bundle size well optimized

### Project Context

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Cloud Functions, Hosting)
- Functions: Now using firebase-functions v4 (v1 API), Node 20
- Region: northamerica-northeast1

**Current Branch:** `fix/storage-bucket-cors`

**Documentation Available:**
- `/docs/IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Full roadmap (25 improvements, updated)
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06F_SUMMARY.md` - Latest session (N+1 query fix)
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06E_SUMMARY.md` - Previous session (Pagination + React.memo)
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06D_SUMMARY.md` - Soft deletes implementation
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06C_SUMMARY.md` - Vite v7 upgrade
- `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06B_SUMMARY.md` - Pull sharing + toast notifications
- `/docs/SYSTEM_ADMIN_MANAGEMENT.md` - Admin system documentation
- `/docs/BACKUP_SETUP.md` - Backup configuration guide
- `/docs/SOFT_DELETES_TEST_PLAN.md` - Soft delete testing guide

### Next Priorities (Medium Priority - Phase 3)

**Recommended Next Steps:**

**Option A: #19 - Integrate Sentry Error Tracking (2 hours)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- **Problem:** No production error monitoring
- **Impact:** Faster bug detection and debugging (would have caught recent `where` import bug)
- **Solution:** Install Sentry SDK, add error boundaries
- **Steps:**
  1. `npm install @sentry/react`
  2. Configure in `main.jsx`
  3. Add error boundaries to key pages
  4. Test error reporting
- **Why this first:** Quick win (2 hours), provides immediate production value

**Option B: #18 - Add Comprehensive Zod Validation (4 hours)**
- **Problem:** Limited runtime validation on user inputs
- **Impact:** Data integrity, better error messages
- **Solution:** Create Zod schemas for all data models
- **Files:** Create `/src/schemas/` directory with validation schemas
- **Why this second:** Complements Sentry (validation errors will be tracked)

### What I Need Help With

Please review the documentation (especially `/docs/IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` and `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06F_SUMMARY.md`) and help me with:

1. **Review current progress** - Read the IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md to understand what's been completed
2. **Choose next task** - Pick one of the recommended options (A or B) based on priority and effort
3. **Track progress** - Use TodoWrite tool to track implementation steps
4. **Update docs** - Update IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md when completing items
5. **Deploy changes** - Build, test, and deploy to production

### Important Notes

- The app is in production use - test thoroughly before deploying
- Always read files before editing them
- All high-priority improvements are complete - now working on medium priority
- Pull sharing feature is working via Firestore Security Rules (not Cloud Functions)
- Soft deletes are implemented for products and shots
- Pagination is implemented for ProductsPage (load more button style)
- React.memo is applied to key list components
- N+1 query patterns fixed in PullsPage (batch loading implemented)

### Commands You'll Likely Need

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only functions

# Test
npm run dev  # Local development server
```

### Project Structure

```
/src
  /components - UI components
  /pages - Page components
  /lib - Firebase config, utilities
  /hooks - Custom React hooks
/functions
  index.js - Cloud Functions (v1 API, firebase-functions v4)
firestore.rules - Security rules
firebase.json - Firebase configuration
```

Please start by reading `/docs/IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` and `/docs/SESSION_2025-10-06F_SUMMARY.md`, then recommend which of the two options (A or B) we should tackle next.
