**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Task:** #22 - Add Skip Navigation Link
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Build Time:** 8.27s
**Tests:** 146/146 passing

---

## 🎯 Objective

Improve keyboard accessibility by adding a skip navigation link that allows users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to main content.

---

## 📊 Summary

Successfully implemented a WCAG 2.1 compliant skip navigation link. Keyboard users can now press Tab once on page load to reveal a "Skip to main content" link that jumps them directly to the page content, bypassing the navigation sidebar.

### What is a Skip Link?

A skip navigation link is an accessibility feature that:
- Appears as the first focusable element on the page
- Is hidden by default (using screen-reader-only techniques)
- Becomes visible when focused via keyboard (Tab key)
- Allows users to jump directly to main content
- Helps users with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

---

## 🛠️ Implementation

### 1. Created SkipLink Component

**File:** `/src/components/ui/SkipLink.jsx`

```jsx
export function SkipLink({ href = "#main-content", children = "Skip to main content" }) {
  return (
    <a
      href={href}
      className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:left-4 focus:top-4 focus:z-[100] focus:rounded-md focus:bg-primary focus:px-4 focus:py-2 focus:text-sm focus:font-medium focus:text-white focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2"
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses `sr-only` utility to hide by default
- `focus:not-sr-only` makes it visible when focused
- Positioned absolutely at top-left (4rem from edges) when focused
- High z-index (100) to appear above all content
- Primary color background with white text for visibility
- Focus ring for additional accessibility
- Fully WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### 2. Integrated into SidebarLayout

**File:** `/src/routes/SidebarLayout.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. Imported SkipLink component
2. Added `<SkipLink />` at the very top of the layout (first element)
3. Added `id="main-content"` to the `<main>` element

**Result:** First Tab press focuses the skip link, activating it jumps to main content
