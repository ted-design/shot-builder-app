# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development for my Shot Builder Firebase app. **Phase 14D** just completed - Performance Optimizations! ⚡

## Current Status: 27/27 phases done ✅

**Latest**: Phase 14D - Post-Merge Performance Optimizations (PR #191 - merged)
- Search input debouncing (150ms, 80-90% fewer operations)
- Fuse.js instance caching (50-70% CPU reduction)
- Cache hit/miss metrics for monitoring
- Max preset limit (20 per page)
- 5 new comprehensive tests
- 237 tests passing

**Branch**: `main` (create new feature branch as needed)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE14D_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

## What I need:

**Option 1**: Tell you a specific improvement or feature I want

**Option 2**: Help with bug fixes, refactoring, or optimization

**Option 3**: Explore Phase 15 options:
- Dark mode support (theme toggle + persistent preference)
- Top navigation bar refactor (sidebar → top nav)
- Recent activity dashboard (user action tracking)
- Additional polish (page transitions, toast animations)

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on project maturity
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test, build, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns. Use lean prompts that reference docs instead of embedding them.
