# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 12 just completed.

**Current Status**: 16 phases done ‚úÖ
- Latest: Phase 12 - Performance & Polish / PDF Lazy Loading (PR #179 - ready for review)
- Complete: PDF bundle optimization (436 kB conditional load), tag system, bulk operations
- Next: Additional performance optimizations OR new feature areas OR custom improvements

**Branch**: `main` (create new branch for next work)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE12_PERFORMANCE_POLISH_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

**What I need**:

**[Option 1] Phase 12.5: Data Caching with TanStack Query**
- Install and configure TanStack Query (React Query)
- Migrate Firestore queries to cached hooks (shots, projects, products)
- Implement optimistic updates for mutations
- Add intelligent cache invalidation
- **Impact**: 50-80% reduction in Firestore reads, lower Firebase costs
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 2] Phase 12.6: List Virtualization**
- Install react-window for virtualized lists
- Virtualize ShotsPage list view (handles 1000+ items smoothly)
- Conditional virtualization for large grids
- **Impact**: Smooth 60 FPS scrolling with massive datasets
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours, LOW risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 3] Planner Enhancements**
- Timeline view for project scheduling
- Capacity planning (shots per day/location)
- Drag-and-drop improvements
- Lane templates and presets
- Export timeline to calendar
- **Estimated time**: 4-5 hours, MEDIUM risk, HIGH impact

**[Option 4] Pulls Advanced Workflows**
- Advanced sharing options (password protection, expiry)
- Custom pull templates
- Bulk add items with filters
- Pull analytics (views, downloads)
- Client feedback collection
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 5] Products Bulk Operations**
- Bulk edit products (pricing, availability, categories)
- Batch import from CSV/Excel
- Product templates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Product analytics
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 6] Tell Me What You Need**
- Specific feature request
- Bug fixes or optimizations
- Testing or deployment
- Documentation updates
- Custom improvement

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current progress
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns.
