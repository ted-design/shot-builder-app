# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development for my Shot Builder Firebase app. **Phase 16.2** just completed - Breadcrumb Navigation! 🗺️✨

## Current Status: 33/33 phases done ✅

**Latest**: Phase 16.2 - Breadcrumb Navigation (PR #198 - Ready for review Oct 14)
- ✅ Breadcrumb component: Home icon + ChevronRight separators
- ✅ Project-aware breadcrumbs: Dashboard > [Project Name] > Planner
- ✅ Dynamic generation based on route and context
- ✅ Breadcrumb utilities library (generateBreadcrumbs, shouldShowBreadcrumbs)
- ✅ TopNavigationLayout integration with project fetching
- ✅ Build validated: 248.21 kB gzipped (+0.71 kB = +0.29%)
- ✅ All 253 tests passing (zero regressions)
- **Result**: Clear navigation context, especially for Planner!

**Branch**: `main` (or create new feature branch)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE16.2_BREADCRUMB_NAVIGATION_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

## What I need:

**Option 1**: Start a new feature or polish task:
- Notifications bell with badge count and dropdown
- Recent items in Quick Actions (recently accessed shots/projects)
- Avatar upload functionality
- Search filter in Quick Actions menu
- Deep navigation breadcrumbs (e.g., Dashboard > Projects > [Project] > Shots > [Shot Name])
- Additional page-level improvements

**Option 2**: Tell you a specific improvement or feature I want

**Option 3**: Help with bug fixes, refactoring, or optimization

Please:
1. Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md` for full context
2. Use `/PHASE16.2_BREADCRUMB_NAVIGATION_SESSION.md` for latest session details
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test, build, update docs, create PR

**Important**: Always read files before editing. Follow existing design patterns. Use lean prompts that reference docs instead of embedding them.
