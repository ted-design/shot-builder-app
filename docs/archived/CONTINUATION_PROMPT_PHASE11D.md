# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 11D just completed.

**Current Status**: 14 phases done ✅
- Latest: Phase 11D - Tag Management Dashboard (PR #177 - ready for review)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE11D_TAG_MANAGEMENT_SESSION.md`
- Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind + Firebase

**What I need**:

**[Option 1] Phase 11E - Extended Bulk Operations**
- Bulk edit location (select multiple shots, set location)
- Bulk edit date (set date for multiple shots)
- Bulk edit type (change shot type for multiple shots)
- Bulk move to different project
- Bulk copy to different project
- ~3-4 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 2] Phase 11E - Smart Tag Features**
- Tag suggestions based on shot properties
- Auto-tagging rules (e.g., location → tag, type → tag)
- Saved filter presets with tags
- Tag-based smart playlists/collections
- Tag templates for common scenarios
- ~3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 3] Phase 11E - Tag Analytics Dashboard**
- Visual charts for tag distribution
- Tag usage trends over time
- Most/least used tags
- Tag correlation analysis
- Export tag reports
- ~2-3 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 4] New Feature Area**
- Pulls enhancements (advanced workflows, filters, sharing)
- Products improvements (batch operations, advanced search)
- Planner refinements (timeline view, capacity planning)
- Dashboard analytics (project progress, team activity)
- Custom improvement

**[Option 5] Tell Me What You Need**
