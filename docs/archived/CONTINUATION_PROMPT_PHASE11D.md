# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing UI/UX improvements for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 11C just completed.

**Current Status**: 13 phases done ‚úÖ
- Latest: Phase 11C - Bulk Tagging System (PR #176 - ready for review)

**Quick Reference**:
- Master roadmap: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Latest session: `/PHASE11C_BULK_TAGGING_SESSION.md`

**What I need**:

**[Option 1] Phase 11D - Tag Management Dashboard**
- Centralized tag library (view all tags across shots)
- Rename tags globally (updates all shots)
- Merge duplicate tags
- Delete unused tags
- Tag usage analytics
- ~3-4 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM-HIGH impact

**[Option 2] Phase 11D - Smart Tag Features**
- Tag suggestions based on shot properties
- Auto-tagging rules (e.g., location ‚Üí tag)
- Saved filter presets with tags
- Tag-based smart playlists
- ~3-4 hours, MEDIUM risk, MEDIUM impact

**[Option 3] Phase 11D - Extended Bulk Operations**
- Bulk edit location (select multiple shots, set location)
- Bulk edit date
- Bulk move to different project
- Bulk export to PDF
- ~2-3 hours, LOW risk, MEDIUM impact

- Custom improvement

**[Option 5] Tell Me What You Need**
