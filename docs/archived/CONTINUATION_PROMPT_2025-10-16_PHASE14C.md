# Shot Builder - Continuation Prompt

I'm continuing development for my Shot Builder Firebase app. Phase 14C just completed - Advanced Search & Filter Presets with fuzzy matching and Cmd+K command palette!

## Current Status

**Phase 14C Complete** ✅ (PR #190 merged)
- **26/26 phases done** - All major feature development complete! 🎉
- Latest work: Phase 14C (Advanced Search & Filter Presets)
- Branch: `main` (or create new from `main`)
- All 232 tests passing (48 new tests added)
- Build: 9.22s | Bundle: 298.65 kB gzipped (+11.64 kB for fuse.js)

**Latest Work**:
- **Phase 14C**: Global command palette (Cmd+K), fuzzy search with fuse.js, filter preset save/load/manage (PR #190 ✅ Merged)
- Added 48 comprehensive tests for search and filter preset utilities
- Fixed 6 critical code review issues (deprecated methods, race conditions, missing dependencies)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with full keyboard navigation

## Quick Reference

**Documentation** (Read these first):
1. **Master Roadmap**: `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`
   - Complete 26-phase history
   - Feature priorities and future opportunities

2. **Latest Session**: `/PHASE14C_SEARCH_FILTER_PRESETS_SESSION.md`

3. **Architecture**: `/docs/shot_builder_overview_updated.md`, `/docs/shot_builder_structure.md`

**Tech Stack**:
- React 18 + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 3
- Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- TanStack Query v5 (100% caching coverage)
- react-window (list virtualization)
- fuse.js (fuzzy search, 6 kB gzipped)
- xlsx (CSV/Excel export, code-split)
- Testing: Vitest + RTL (232 tests passing)

## What I Need

**Option 1**: Post-Merge Enhancements from Code Review
- Add search input debouncing (150-200ms)
- Add max preset limit (20 per page)
- Cache Fuse.js instances for performance
- Monitor bundle size impact
- Expected time: 2-3 hours

**Option 2**: Testing & Quality Improvements
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Expand component test coverage
- Visual regression testing
- Performance profiling and benchmarks

**Option 3**: Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design refinements
- Touch gesture improvements
- Mobile-specific UI patterns
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

**Option 4**: Future Enhancements
- Search result highlighting
- Preset categories/folders
- Cloud sync for presets
- Search analytics
- Real-time collaboration features

**Option 5**: Specific feature/improvement
- Tell me what you want to build/fix
- I'll create a plan and implement

## Your Approach

Please:
1. **Read `/docs/MOCKUP_INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md`** for full context
2. Suggest the best next step based on current state
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Work efficiently - test builds, update docs, create PR

## Important Guardrails

- ✅ **Read files before editing** - Use Read tool first
- ✅ **Follow patterns** - Check similar implementations
- ✅ **Test thoroughly** - All 232 tests must pass
- ✅ **Document changes** - Create session docs for significant work
- ✅ **Zero regressions** - Maintain backwards compatibility
- ✅ **Performance** - Monitor bundle size and build time
- ✅ **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- ✅ **Security** - Validate inputs, prevent injection attacks
